# EDScreenshot

Just a quick python Script that I wrote to monitor the Elite Dangerous Journal file for a screenshot. Rename that Screenshot, convert it to a PNG and remove the original BMP

Oh! And because I am super lazy, I added the script to Lutris as a Linux "game"

* Game Options: `/usr/bin/ptyxis`
* Arguments: `-x ~/EDScreenshot/EDScreenshot.sh`

Hopefully it goes without saying that you'll need to update the shell script with your paths because you're not using mine :P

For what it's worth my copy of Elite is installed to `~/Games/umu/umu-default/drive_c/users/steamuser/Saved Games/Frontier Developments/Elite Dangerous`
 and my screenshots are in `~/Games/umu/umu-default/drive_c/users/steamuser/Pictures/Frontier Developments/Elite Dangerous`
